Many students have two versions of their resume. One that is ATS friendly and another that is stylized. The stylized resume can be shared directly with a prospective employer via email.

// LinkedIn Basics

When connecting with people on LinkedIn, you want to keep it personal. Think of your LinkedIn network like your real-life network, meaning you want to connect with people you know in real life.


Be careful about how many invitations you send out and to whom. If enough people ignore your invitation or mark that they don’t know you, LinkedIn may prevent you from sending out invitations. Yikes!


Another tip to follow, when you connect with people you just met, make sure you add a custom message to the invitation. **Never use the default message that pops up.  Below is an example of a good custom message.



Hi Brad,
It was great to meet you at the (Event Name) meetup!
I’d love to stay in touch.

However, if you’d like to make a cold outreach or connect with someone you never “met”, here are a few ways to go about it:




Pay them a compliment. Maybe you read their blog and love it. If that’s the case, let them know this in your invitation message. Say something like, “Hey! I follow your blog and love what you share. Wanted to stay up to date with you on LinkedIn as well.”




Identify a mutual connection. And use that shared connection as your “in.”




Note a common interest. Perhaps you’re both members of a certain LinkedIn group, or you both volunteer with the same nonprofit.




The point is: whenever connecting with someone on LinkedIn, make sure you give them a reason why they should accept your invitation. If they are unsure who you are, and your invitation message is blank, the chances of them connecting with you is slim to none. Especially for influencers who are bombarded with invites every day.
